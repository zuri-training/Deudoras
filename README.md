About the project

Many school owners experience financial losses as a result of  students who owe and then change their school in order not to pay up their outstanding debts. That is why we came up with Deudoras, a platform for schools to be able to track these debtors even when they try to enroll in another school within their locality.

Deudoras is a website application that enables school owners in  Gbagada locality to upload the database of students who are debtors on the platform and make this list of students available to other schools in the community that are registered on the platform. The website application will help school administrators track down debtors and this will go a long way in helping them recover their funds.

Features

There are two levels of access on the platform; one for unauthenticated users, and the other for authenticated users.

    Unauthenticated users:

This access is for anyone who uses our url to visit the platform.
They will have access to the basic information about us such as - an overview of the platform, our contact pages and what services we offer. These will be available on the landing page.
View and interact with the documentation. There will be a documentation which will list all the goals the platform intends to help clients (school owners) achieve, how to navigate and use the platform effectively, and many more directives.
They won't have access to core platform data. This simply means that a user who has not registered wonâ€™t be able to access data such as the list of debtors in any school, etc.
They will have to register to view more details. There will be more features and documentations to access when a user decides to register.

    Authenticated users:

Full access to the platform. All authenticated users will be able to access all the features in the platform.
Verify details before full access to the platform. Before full access to the platform is given to registered clients, school owners will have to verify they own the school while students will have to verify that they belong to the school they claim they are in.
Post new data about a debtor. Means they have the access to update the list of debtors, when a student becomes a debtor, they have access to post it.
Allow debtors to challenge - contend. An individual who has been posted as a debtor will have access to challenge or contend that particular post but can only win when certain conditions are met.
Comment on posts by others. There will be a comment box under every post where all every authenticated user can comment.
