            <p>
              In order to prevent your school from suffering financial losses as
              a result of debts, we help to facilitate and improve the process
              of recovering debt from defaulting students. In addition to giving
              you the chance to learn useful details about other community
              schools, our platform assists you in successfully recovering
              payments from defaulting students. Debtors are made accountable
              with the aid of Deudoras, which relieves you of your concerns.

            Our goal is to ensure that parents are held liable for the payment
            of their children's tuition and to significantly minimize the rate
            at which local schools experience financial losses as a result of
            pupils defaulting on payments.

            We are firm believers that commerce can thrive while upholding moral
            principles, which is why we developed a debtors platform that
            enables Gbagada local schools to upload a list of students who have
            unpaid school fees in order to stop them from enrolling in other
            schools.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            According to research, 30 percent of students have not yet paid for
            the previous year's tuition, which is indicative of the epidemic of
            parents' and guardians' irregular fee payments. Additionally,
            parents who transfer their kids to different schools without paying
            the necessary fees are trying to outsmart the school. We started by
            addressing the basic problems of students not paying their due fees
            and transferring to other schools as well as providing a trustworthy
            method of fee debt tracking. As a result, most schools close their
            doors due to a lack of funds used to maintain the school structure,
            leaving school owners at an all-time low and occasionally running
            into debt while attempting to maintain the school.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to address the issue, we at Deudoras conducted the required
            research to better understand our target audience. After reviewing
            the results of the research, we went on to develop this platform. In
            order to secure the smooth operation of their schools, our purpose
            was to assist in relieving school owners of the persistent problem
            of school fee defaulters.
